Answers to problem 1

1. The command that lets you see your absolute path is "pwd".
2. The command is “ls”. Both the “patterns.txt” and “symmetry.py” files should show up.
3. Typing "nano patterns.txt" will allow you to open up the file.
4. Typing "cat patterns.txt" will allow you to print the file's contents.
5. Typing in "diff patterns.txt symmetry.txt" will let you see the differences between the two files.
6. mv patterns.txt ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt
7. rm ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt
8. cd ../math/
9. git init
10. git remote add origin git@github.com:santi_agu/math.git
11. cp ~/music/ symmetry.txt .
12. git status. Git is not currently tracking symmetry.txt, because it has not been added to the staging area.
13. The first command is “git add symmetry.txt”, and the second is “git add .”
14. Yes, git is tracking it.  To unstage the file, type “git reset symmetry.txt”
15. git commit -m “Copied symmetry.txt from music directory”
16. git push origin main. The branch you should push to is the main branch, since it is the only branch that exists at the moment.
17. git branch applied_math
18. git checkout applied_math
19. “git add .”, then “git commit -m “Added physics directory and mechanics.txt.”, and finally “git push origin applied_math”. Changing branches before committing will make you lose all your progress. 
20. To see all branches, type in "git branch". The branch in green is the current branch.
21. git checkout main
22. git merge applied_math
23. Screenshot is in another file
