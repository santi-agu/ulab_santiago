# A temperate super-Jupiter imaged with JWST in the mid-infrared





# Researchers claim to have found a larger than Jupiter sized exoplanet through JWST's infrared camera.
# They also claim that the previous data mischaracterized many properties of this planet, and that this is the only large planet in the system.
# I trust their methods because I am only a college freshman and they are actual physicists.
# However, it is a bit suspicious that they don't give concrete numbers for the planet's brightness,
# despite the fact that they keep mentioning that it is particularly bright.





# Its discovery method (radial velocity), its temperature (275 K), and its star's spectral type (K5 V) are consistent with the paper.
# The pl_refname also mentions the authors of the paper.





# The paper mentions the distance from Earth to the planet, along with its star's age, but the data makes no mention of that.
# The paper also mentions the planet's proper motion, which I don't think was in the data.
